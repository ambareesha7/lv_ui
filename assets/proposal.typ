= Policy Proposal: New Recycling Initiative

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Description:*

This proposal aims to improve our city's recycling program by implementing a new curbside pickup system and expanding the types of materials that can be recycled.

*Problem:*

Our current recycling program is outdated and inefficient. Many residents do not recycle because it is inconvenient and confusing. As a result, we are wasting valuable resources and contributing to environmental pollution.

*Proposal:*

1. Implement a new curbside pickup system that makes it easier for residents to recycle. This system would include larger recycling bins and weekly pickups.

2. Expand the types of materials that can be recycled to include glass, plastic, paper, and metal.

3. Educate residents about the importance of recycling and how to use the new system.

*Benefits:*

1. Reduce waste and conserve resources.

2. Improve the environment and public health.

3. Save money by reducing waste disposal costs.

4. Boost the local economy by creating jobs in the recycling industry.
